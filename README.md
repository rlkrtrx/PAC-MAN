## Requirements 

I compiled the project on MacOS, therefore if you are to come
from a different OS, make sure to change the makefile and 
adjust the code accordingly.

 - GLFW3+ for input and output
 - GL3W headers for OpenGL
 - QDBMP for reading BMPs
 - linmath for Linear Transformations and Matrices
 - stb_image.h for loading PNGs
